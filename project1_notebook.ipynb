    "**Due:** 5PM on Fri October 10  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Directions\n",
    "- Include a report on every group member’s contribution.  \n",
    "- Submit the group’s well-commented code used for the project with instructions on how to compile and run.  \n",
    "- Make a 15 to 20 minute video presentation of your results.  \n",

    "The project consists of 3 problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given part of the **Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset**. For each patient, you are given a vector $\\mathbf{a}$ giving features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The goal is to decide whether the cells are malignant or benign.  \n",

    "### Feature Computation\n",
    "Ten real-valued quantities are computed for each cell nucleus:\n",
    "- **radius** (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)  \n",
    "- **texture** (standard deviation of gray-scale values)  \n",
    "- **perimeter**  \n",
    "- **area**  \n",
    "- **smoothness** (local variation in radius lengths)  \n",
    "- **compactness** $\\;=\\; \\dfrac{\\text{perimeter}^2}{\\text{area}} - 1.0$  \n",
    "- **concavity** (severity of concave portions of the contour)  \n",
    "- **concave points** (number of concave portions of the contour)  \n",
    "- **symmetry**  \n",
    "- **fractal dimension** (“coastline approximation” - 1)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **mean**, **standard error (stderr)**, and a measure of the **largest (worst)** values were computed for each feature.  \n",
    "Thus, each specimen is represented by a vector $\\mathbf{a}$ with **30 entries**.  \n",

    "The domain $D$ consists of thirty strings identifying these features, e.g.  \n",
